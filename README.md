# Hexagonal Architecture (Currently Studying)

- Ports and Adapters
- Separate the Technical Complexity with the Business Complexity
- Important points about Architectures:
  * Sustainable Growth
  * Software has to be paid in long time
  * The software has to be designed by you, not by the framework (you cannot depend of the framework)
  * Peaces has to fit in and substituted eventually
  * Architecture is: think in future!
